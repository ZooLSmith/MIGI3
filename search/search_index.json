Rules: As a mod user you should never rename downloaded addons. Some addons are made to be used offline or with people that have the same addons, those won't work online or in demos. Other addons are made for playing on sv_pure 0 servers or used in demos, those are limited but more compatible. Addons can't override the same weapon / item, if they do, either the game will crash or won't behave as intended. M _ (MIGI) VPKs M _ VPKs are standard MIGI addons, they have config files that get appended while generating the pak. Those can only be used offline or in lobbies if you're the host / have the same addon as the host. They usually replace game items like weapons, sounds, particles, and more.

Introduction As said in previous sections, MIGI uses two specific addon formats, either with the prefix p_ or m_ M _ VPKs Recommended M _ VPKs are what you should use most of the time, they're easier to share around as well. M_ Folders are \"src files\", this is what we use to generate the vpk file which is then used by the game. Once ready to test your addon, you need to click the button on the left to make it usable inside MIGI. If that button turns yellow it means your addon is outdated and needs to be rebuilt, if it's green it means it's up-to-date. You should then see a file named the same as your folder but with .vpk at the end. You can also create folder named #pak at the root to mimic what a P_ folder does. Example: m_myaddon/#pak/materials/panorama/images/equipment/ak47.svg which will then be moved to the Pak 01 on each full build. Note: Do not use #pak for every single file. Only files that are originally inside CS:GO's Pak 01 in order to replace them. P _ Folders Recommended for personal use and tests It is impossible to replace an existing asset unless overwritten inside a new Pak . MIGI supports doing so using those P _ folders, which gets their files added to the new additive Pak 01 when building. This is identical to what the #pak folder does on M _ addons except without the whole \"extracting from the vpk\" stuff. Note: While P _ folders can seem simply better, MIGI requires to copy their content ON EVERY FULL BUILD , which is also true for the #pak folder inside M _ addons. The more data P _ folders will have, the longer it'll take MIGI and VPK.EXE to copy those files and compress them in that new Pak 01.
